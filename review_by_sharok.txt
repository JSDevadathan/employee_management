// service class

# createEmployee()

1. It should be better to use mapping instead of builder in user.
2. Good to have an exception for email id already exists.

# getEmployeesByDepartment()

1. Its goods to throw an exception, when there is no employee in searched department.
  (Could use a common parent exceptions class and use it where ever needed)

// controller class

# getEmployeesByDepartment()

1. String department should be given as request param instead of path variable as per question.

// Application.yml

1. Db username and password should not be provide in application.properties
